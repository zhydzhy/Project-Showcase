                    <h4>Light Sensor Swarm System</h4>
                    <p> I designed and implemented a Light Sensor Swarm System using a distributed IoT network consisting
                       of six ESP8266 nodes and a Raspberry Pi as the central hub, achieving a 95% data transmission 
                       success rate over UDP. To enhance network flexibility, I developed a dynamic device discovery 
                       protocol using UDP, which reduced node reconfiguration time by 50% compared to traditional 
                       static setups. Additionally, I optimized power consumption by implementing intelligent sleep 
                       cycles, significantly extending battery life while ensuring real-time responsiveness for 
                       continuous light monitoring. This system demonstrates efficient wireless communication, 
                       scalability, and energy-aware operation in IoT deployments.

                <h4>Traffic Detection System </h4>
                <p>
                    I developed a traffic detection system that leverages synthetic datasets generated from RGB cameras 
                    and LiDAR sensors to train a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for identifying hazardous interactions on 
                    the road. Using the CARLA simulation platform, I generated RGB and LiDAR data, then projected LiDAR 
                    point clouds onto RGB images to create hybrid images, enhancing the model's ability to recognize 
                    complex scenarios. The dataset was specifically designed to include challenging traffic conditions 
                    and edge cases, such as unexpected accidents and sudden traffic disruptions, ensuring the model's 
                    robustness and stability in real-world road environments. After training the VLM on this dataset to 
                    detect road hazards, the final goal was to deploy the optimized model onto embedded Edge AI devices 
                    using Python, C++, and Linux for real-time danger detection.
