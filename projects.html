      <p>
        Developed a multimodal traffic detection system combining RGB and LiDAR sensor data to train a Vision-Language Model (VLM)
        for corner-case hazard detection in autonomous driving. Generated synthetic datasets using CARLA, applied RGB-LiDAR projection fusion,
        and optimized the trained model for real-time embedded inference using Raspberry Pi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed and implemented a multimodal traffic detection pipeline that integrates RGB camera and LiDAR point cloud data
        for robust corner-case hazard understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Built a synthetic dataset generation engine in CARLA,
        covering rare events such as occlusions, adverse weather, near-miss collisions, and unusual agent behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developed an RGB-LiDAR projection-based fusion module to convert LiDAR depth and reflectance into RGB-aligned channels, enabling downstream
        Vision-Language Models (MiniCPM-o, Qwen-VL, BLIP-2 variants) to perform spatial reasoning and semantic grounding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implemented ontology-driven annotation using AVCCO ontology and TTL triples to guide model reasoning and generate structured hazard explanations.
        Optimized the full pipeline for real-time inference on embedded platforms using Python, PyTorch, and C++, including quantization, dynamic
        resolution scaling, and an edge-cloud hierarchical architecture where a lightweight edge model filters scenes before offloading complex
        reasoning to a larger backend VLM.

    <section class="project-item reveal" id="lean-library">
      <h2>Lean Improvement Knowledge Library Platform</h2>
      <p class="project-period"><em>Enterprise Web System, Manufacturing IT</em></p>
      <p><em>.NET 8, SQL Server, Dapper, JavaScript</em></p>
      <p>
        Developed an enterprise-scale Lean Improvement Knowledge Library to digitize, standardize, and govern continuous-improvement cases across a
        manufacturing organization, supporting ~900 internal users as a centralized knowledge and analytics platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed and implemented a full-stack web system using ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) and SQL Server, with secure cookie-based authentication,
        role-based access control, and RESTful APIs to support long-term operational use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modeled organizational ownership through departments and positions instead of individual employees, enabling scalable maintenance and
        reducing administrative overhead during personnel or structure changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built high-performance search, filtering, and analytics workflows using Dapper-optimized SQL queries, delivering sub-second response times
        and reducing improvement retrieval from minutes to seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implemented dynamic frontend components for cascaded classification, attachments, and in-browser preview, improving data consistency,
        usability, and cross-department reuse of Lean improvement knowledge.

    <section class="project-item reveal" id="light-sensor-swarm">
      <h2>Light Sensor Swarm System</h2>
      <p class="project-period">
        <em>ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, IoT Networking</em>
        <a href="https://github.com/zhydzhy/Light-Swarm-Dectection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed a distributed IoT system with six ESP8266 light sensor nodes communicating via UDP to a central
        Raspberry Pi hub. Built a dynamic discovery protocol reducing setup time by 50% and implemented power-aware
        sleep scheduling to extend battery life. Achieved 95% transmission reliability with real-time light tracking.

      <h2>Real-Time Canny Edge Detection Optimization</h2>
      <p class="project-period"><em>OpenCV, Multi-threading, PSNR Evaluation</em></p>
      <p>
        Enhanced real-time edge detection performance by optimizing Canny Edge algorithms with multi-threading
        and dynamic frequency scaling. Integrated PSNR-based image quality evaluation and benchmarked performance
        across different threading strategies for embedded applications.

      <h2>Network Simulation</h2>
      <p class="project-period"><em>Python, FRRouting, ContainerLab, Docker</em></p>
      <p>
        Designed and automated deployment of 10+ virtual routers using ContainerLab with dynamic BGP and OSPF routing protocols,
        reducing topology setup time by 40%. Coordinated a team of three to implement, test, and present the simulation,
        earning a positive faculty evaluation. The project emphasized scalable network automation, containerized lab orchestration,
        and hands-on routing protocol configuration in a virtualized environment.
