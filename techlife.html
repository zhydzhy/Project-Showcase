    <h1>My Take on Technology & Life</h1>
    <p>
      Technology should work <em>for</em> you — quietly, predictably, and without asking for permission every five minutes.
      My philosophy is simple: <strong>build what you can trust, and understand what you use</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Daily Driving Linux</h2>
    <p>
      I use <strong><a href="https://omarchy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omarchy</a></strong>, an opinionated Arch Linux setup built on Hyprland.
      It’s fast, minimal, and completely under my control — no nags, no background analytics, no “smart” assistants that phone home. Though I had to delete
      some pre-installed bloatware as well, but I'm satisfied with it for now.
    </p>

    <h2>The Windows Rant</h2>
    <p>
      Every time I boot into Windows, I’m greeted by a pop-up asking if I’d like to use Bing.
      Then another one about Microsoft Edge. Then “helpful suggestions” from the Store.  
      The Start menu isn’t a launcher anymore — it’s a billboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the search bar doesn’t search my files first; it wants to search the web, 
      run ads, or “personalize results.”  
      I just want to find a document, not argue with Bing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more they tighten the grip on <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsoft-clamping-down-on-windows-11-local-account-setup-latest-insider-build-removes-local-only-commands-skipping-microsoft-account-sign-in-will-crash-setup-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telemetry, ads, and “recommended content”</a>,  
    the more it feels like using your own computer on borrowed time.
      Linux is my way out — no telemetry, no surprises, no assistant watching my keystrokes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though in some occasions I still need Windows for certain software or games,
      especially those that refuse to run on Linux via Proton or WINE. Like League of Legends, 
      BattleField 6, Online Matching Platforms for CS2 like Perfect World or 5E, and basically any AAA titles with anti-cheat systems or kernel level "protection"
      (they just add more vulnerabilities to your devices).
