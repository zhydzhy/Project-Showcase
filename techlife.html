      <h1>My Take on Technology & Life</h1>
      <p>
        Technology should work <em>for</em> you - quietly, predictably, and without asking for permission every five minutes.
        My philosophy is simple: <strong>build what you can trust, and understand what you use</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Daily Driving Linux</h2>
      <p>
        I use <strong><a href="https://linux.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux</a></strong>, an alternative operating system to Windows and macOS, as my daily driver.
        It's fast, minimal, and completely under my control - no nags, no background analytics, no "smart" assistants that phone home.
        It was not an easy shift: I have nuked my entire GUI, messed up my bootloader, and destroyed drivers just by updating them.
        After hopping across many distros, I am satisfied with it for now.
      </p>

      <h2>The Windows Rant</h2>
      <p>
        Every time I boot into Windows, I'm greeted by a pop-up asking if I'd like to use Bing.
        Then another one about Microsoft Edge. Then "helpful suggestions" from the Store.
        The Start menu is not a launcher anymore - it is a billboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the search bar does not search my files first; it wants to search the web,
        run ads, or "personalize results."
        I just want to find a document, not argue with Bing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more they tighten the grip on
        <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsoft-clamping-down-on-windows-11-local-account-setup-latest-insider-build-removes-local-only-commands-skipping-microsoft-account-sign-in-will-crash-setup-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telemetry, ads, and recommended content</a>,
        the more it feels like using your own computer on borrowed time.
        Linux is my way out - no telemetry, no surprises, no assistant watching my keystrokes and total control.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some occasions I still need Windows for certain software or games, especially those that refuse to run on Linux via Proton or WINE.
        For example, League of Legends, Battlefield 6, online matching platforms for CS2 like Perfect World or 5E, and most AAA titles with anti-cheat systems
        or kernel-level "protection" (they just add more vulnerabilities to your devices).
